      <h1>So what are my insterests?</h1>
      <p class="my-interests">I like to learn / try out new things all the time. </p>

        Video editing:</span> Currently I'm learning video editing because I'm very creative
        and can come up with new unique things easily, so editing videos is easy for me. Video editing is also 
        one of these jobs where you can work for yourself, so you don't need a boss, or someone who's above you
        that tells you what to do. You basically have your own schedule which is easier and less stressful.

      <p class="my-interests">
        <span class="my-interests-title">Friends and family:</span> I like to be with friends and family. My family 
        is always with me, we can watch movies-, play games- and study toghether. Same goes for my friends, we can 
        hang out-, go to the cinema- and play video games toghether. 
      </p>

      <p class="my-interests">
        <span class="my-interests-title">Video games:</span> I like to play videogames because it's fun.
      </p>

      <p class="my-interests">
        <span class="my-interests-title">Sleeping:</span> I'm a very heavy sleeper.. You can drop a bomb next to my bed
        and I won't even notice. I like that I'm a heavy sleeper but it can be annoying sometimes because I for example
        never hear my alarm in the morning, so I need someone to wake me up. I also sleepwalk sometimes. My sleep schedule 
        is messed up and I can sleep for 13+ hours and still feel tired when I wake up.
